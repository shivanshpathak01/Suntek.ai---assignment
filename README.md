## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions for Local Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Supabase account
- OpenAI API key (optional, for AI features)

### 1. Clone and Install
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd task-tracker
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Configuration
Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

# JWT Secret (generate a strong random string)
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here_change_this_to_a_random_string

# OpenAI API Key (optional - for AI task suggestions)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your_openai_api_key
```

### 3. Database Setup
1. Create a new Supabase project
2. In the Supabase SQL Editor, run the schema from `database/schema.sql`
3. This will create the required tables: `users`, `tasks`, and `time_logs`

### 4. Run the Application
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

### 5. First Time Setup
1. Navigate to `/signup` to create your account
2. Login and start creating tasks
3. Use the timer functionality to track time on your tasks

## üì± Application Structure

### Pages
- **`/`** - Main dashboard (requires authentication)
- **`/login`** - User login page
- **`/signup`** - User registration page

### Key Features Explained

#### Real-time Timer Tracking
- **Individual Task Timers**: Each task displays its total tracked time, updating in real-time
- **Live Timer Display**: Running timers show current duration (e.g., "Stop (5m 23s)")
- **Automatic Updates**: Total tracked time updates immediately when timers are stopped
- **Smart Completion**: When a task is marked as "Completed", any running timer automatically stops

#### Daily Summary
- **Real-time Total**: Shows total time tracked for the current day, updates without page refresh
- **Task Categorization**: Displays tasks grouped by status (Completed, In Progress, Pending)
- **Live Updates**: Summary refreshes automatically when tasks are updated or timers are used

## üîå API Endpoints

### Authentication

## üöÄ Deployment

### Vercel Deployment (Recommended)
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your repository to Vercel
3. Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - `JWT_SECRET`
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY` (optional)
4. Deploy!

### Other Platforms
The app can be deployed on any platform that supports Next.js:
- Netlify
- Railway
- DigitalOcean App Platform
- AWS Amplify

Ensure environment variables are configured and the database schema is applied to your Supabase instance.

## üîí Security Notes

### Authentication System
This application uses custom JWT authentication implemented in the application layer. The current setup does **not** use Supabase Auth but rather implements its own authentication system.

### Supabase RLS (Row Level Security)
**Important**: This app currently has RLS disabled on Supabase. If you want to enable RLS:

1. **Option 1**: Migrate to Supabase Auth and enable RLS with policies:
```sql
alter table users enable row level security;
alter table tasks enable row level security;
alter table time_logs enable row level security;

create policy "users_self" on users
  for select using (auth.uid() = id)
  with check (auth.uid() = id);

create policy "tasks_by_owner" on tasks
  for all using (auth.uid() = user_id) 
  with check (auth.uid() = user_id);

create policy "time_logs_by_owner" on time_logs
  for all using (auth.uid() = user_id) 
  with check (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

2. **Option 2**: Keep custom JWT and implement service role policies (advanced)
